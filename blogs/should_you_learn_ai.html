          Dear readers, do you remember the 2000s where we used to watch skynet
          take over the world in the terminator movie? Or iRobot where robots
          find their own conscience? What used to be sci-fi in the 2000s is more
          closer to reality than you may think.

              If you've read my other blogs, you must know I love to start off
              with some history. Recently, I've started taking a liking for two
              very new subjects. History and Economics. I've come to the
              realisation that one cannot appreciate the present without knowing
              the past. The decisions our ancestors took that decided the way we
              live today. But why Economics? Well, I believe economics is the
              subject of the present and the future.

              Coming back to the topic of AI, ultimately AI and Machine Learning
              is built on the foundations of mathematical concepts. It's just
              that with today's computing power, we are able to use huge amounts
              of data to generate complex mathematical models that are hard to
              represent in traditional mathematical notations. So my point
              being, the foundations of AI has been laid almost a century ago by
              mathematicians. Let me share with you some key developments in
              this field which helped us reach where we are today with AI tools.

              I'm sure there won't be many engineers who hasn't heard of the
              Moore's law. But for the sake of my occasional non-tech readers,
              let me briefly describe, what I would call, the single most
              important principle that drives technology forward.
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
              Moore's law began as an observation made by <b>Gordon Moore</b> in
              1965, that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles
              approximately every two years, while the cost per transistor
              decreases. Now you may think, why I would give so much credit to a
              rather simple "observation" made decades ago. Moore's law is so
              fascinating, because of it's <b>accuracy</b> even after 50+ years.
              If you look at the below chart of transistors per microchip, it is
              still very much following a trend someone predicted half a century
              ago. And, it's this trend in growth of computer chips that made it
              possible for humans to build supercomputers capable of training
              models like GPT and llama

          <div class="subheader-text">Type 1 and Type 2 Hypervisor</div>
          <div class="project-details-content">
            <div class="body-text">
              If the hypervisor software runs directly on a hardware, then it is
              called a type 1 hypervisor. If the hypervisor requires a different
              Operating System to be installed on the hardware, then it is a
              type 2 hypervsior. Both types of hypervisors have its own use
              cases. Systems built specifically for Virtualization usually use
              Type 1 hypervisors, while Type 2 hypervisors provide some extra
              configurations. Some examples of Type 1 hypervisors are KVM, Xen
              and RedHat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV). Type 2 hypervisors
              include Oracle VirtualBox, Microsoft Hyper-V, etc.

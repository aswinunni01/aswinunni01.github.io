          Dear readers, do you remember the 2000s where we used to watch skynet
          take over the world in the terminator movie? Or iRobot where a robot
          finds it's own conscience? What used to be sci-fi in the 2000s is more
          closer to reality than you may think.

              If you've read my other blogs, you must know I love to start off
              with some history. Recently, I've started taking a liking for two
              very new subjects. History and Economics. I've come to the
              realisation that one cannot appreciate the present without knowing
              the past. With History, you understand the decisions our ancestors
              took decided today's way of life, and that has helped me answer a
              lot of questions I have about the present. And with Economics, you
              understand how to prepare for the future.

              Coming back to the topic of AI, ultimately AI and Machine Learning
              are built on the foundations of mathematical concepts. It's just
              that with today's computing power, we are able to use huge amounts
              of data to derive complex mathematical models that are nearly
              impossible to represent in traditional mathematical notations. So
              my point being, the foundations of AI has been laid almost a
              century ago by mathematicians. Let me share with you some key
              developments in this field which helped us reach where we are
              today with AI tools.

              I'm sure there won't be many engineers who hasn't heard of the
              Moore's law. But for the sake of my occasional non-tech readers,
              let me briefly describe, what I would call, the single most
              important principle that drives technology forward.
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
              Moore's law began as an observation made by <b>Gordon Moore</b> in
              1965, that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles
              approximately every two years, while the cost per transistor
              decreases. Now you may think, why I would give so much credit to a
              rather simple "observation" made decades ago. Moore's law is so
              fascinating, because of it's <b>accuracy</b> even after 50+ years.
              If you look at the below chart of transistors per microchip, it is
              still very much following a trend someone predicted half a century
              ago. And, it's this trend in growth of computer chips that made it
              possible for humans to build supercomputers capable of training
              models like GPT and llama.

          <div class="subheader-text">Should you be worried about AI?</div>
          <div class="project-details-content">
            <div class="body-text">
              Yes, and no. The way I see it, AI is going to eliminate a lot of
              <b>incompetent</b> people from the market. The whole concept of
              GenAI is to repeat things which it has seen previously, in the
              context of the current prompt. This approach is only good enough
              to do trivial, redundant tasks which has already been done by many
              other people. So, my dear friend, if you are incompetent, or don't
              keep youself upskilled, then within then next 4 years (2029) you
              can probably be replaced by AI, or someone who knows how to use it
              to his advantage.
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
              On the other hand, AI is an invaluable tool for inquisitive people
              who try to keep themselves upskilled. GenAI tools have made
              learning easier than never before. It's like having your personal
              tutor in your pocket at all times, who can feed you high quality
              data in simple language and answer all your questions. And that is
              exactly what AI is good at. It is good at teaching you theory from
              the books in simple language. You just need to know how to ask.
              Like the bible says "<i>Ask, and it shall be given to you</i>".

              The only way to prevent AI from mastering you is to master it
              first. Understand what AI can do for you, and use it to your
              advantage. Here are some tools you can start off with

                  <b>ChatGPT:</b>
                  Nowadays I learn new things by going to ChatGPT and asking it
                  questions on the topic. Once I have a basic understanding, I
                  browse the web and find articles to read. I have found this
                  method really effective.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>ClaudeAI:</b>As a software engineer I often come across the
                  need for quick prototyping. You can give screenshots to Claude
                  and ask it to build your app.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Gemini:</b> Not as good as ChatGPT in my experience, but
                  when ChatGPT runs out of free prompts, I go to Gemini.

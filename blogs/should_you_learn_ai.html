          Dear readers, do you remember the 2000s where we used to watch skynet
          take over the world in the terminator movie? Or iRobot where robots
          find their own conscience? What used to be sci-fi in the 2000s is more
          closer to reality than you may think.

              If you've read my other blogs, you must know I love to start off
              with some history. Recently, I've started taking a liking for two
              very new subjects. History and Economics. I've come to the
              realisation that one cannot appreciate the present without knowing
              the past. The decisions our ancestors took that decided the way we
              live today. But why Economics? Well, I believe economics is the
              subject of the present and the future.

              From a software engineering standpoint, a lot of applications
              still do not scale up well(adding CPU, memory, etc.) - they cannot
              be parallelized. That means, if an application cannot use all the
              resources at its disposal, a server is going to have a lot of
              unused compute resources. Having multiple VMs on the hardware
              running its own OS and processes can make use of hardware more
              efficiently. So, my point is, virtualization gives us a lot of
              benefits when managing hardware, IF it is used right. It helps in
              :
              <ol>
                <li>More efficient use of hardware resources</li>
                <li>
                  Ensuring privacy between different software components running
                  on the same hardware
                </li>
                <li>
                  Flexible allocation of hardware resources among multiple
                  software systems on the same hardware
                </li>
                <li>Creating and destroying and recreating machines easily.</li>
                <li>
                  Creating large number of machines with the same configuration.

            Hypervisor / Virtual Machine Manager (VMM)
          </div>
          <div class="project-details-content">
            <div class="body-text">
              As the name suggests, Hypervisor or Virtual Machine Manager is a
              piece of software that is responsible for managing and controlling
              virtual machines. It is responsible for managing hardware
              resources across VMs, ensuring data and hardware privacy, managing
              the lifecycle of virtual machines and so on. One important task of
              the hypervisor is how efficiently it can handle IO and Memory
              access of all the VMs while maintaining data integrity.

          <div class="subheader-text">Type 1 and Type 2 Hypervisor</div>
          <div class="project-details-content">
            <div class="body-text">
              If the hypervisor software runs directly on a hardware, then it is
              called a type 1 hypervisor. If the hypervisor requires a different
              Operating System to be installed on the hardware, then it is a
              type 2 hypervsior. Both types of hypervisors have its own use
              cases. Systems built specifically for Virtualization usually use
              Type 1 hypervisors, while Type 2 hypervisors provide some extra
              configurations. Some examples of Type 1 hypervisors are KVM, Xen
              and RedHat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV). Type 2 hypervisors
              include Oracle VirtualBox, Microsoft Hyper-V, etc.
